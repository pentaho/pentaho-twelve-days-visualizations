# Sun Burst Visualization

The Sun Burst visualization shows a hierarchy as a series of rings.
Each ring represents the children of the ring it encloses.
The outer ring can have a color gradient. 

You can click on segments to select them for keep/exclude.
You can double-click to drill down.
Mouse over highlights a segment.
You can use a color gradient or a gradient based on the pie-slice colors. 
You can have natural order or descending order.
You can change the background color/gradient and  the label font/color.
You can reverse the color gradient.

This visualization has been superseeded by the correpsonding Common-UI visualization,
and as such is disabled by default (change this in `/resources/config/vizTypes.json`).
